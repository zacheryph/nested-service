# Nested Service

This is a very simple HTTP service for me to play around with `Go` and `Consul`.  Some of my first Go code so please don't grade it ;)

## Installation

The `build.sh` script will pull down a golang container to compile the service.  `docker-compose` will handle creating the service container from the `Dockerfile`

```
$ ./build.sh
$ docker-compose up
```

## Usage

_TODO_
